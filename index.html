            <p class="speaker">Farhan Sadeek:</p>
            <p class="text">Awesome! I wanted to conduct an interview about your work on machine learning. My scientific
                article is based on machine learning in healthcare, and I thought you would be a great fit for this
                discussion since you were my professor. I checked your LinkedIn profile and saw that you’re working with
                machine learning, specifically in ocean temperature prediction. Although the topics might
                differ—healthcare versus ocean temperature—the questions are quite broad and elementary, so you’d likely
                be a good fit for this. My first question is: Can you tell me a bit more about the research you’re doing
                so I can get a better understanding?</p>
        </div>

        <div class="interview-section">
            <p class="timestamp">[00:00:46]</p>
            <p class="speaker">Can Alpay:</p>
            <p class="text">Alright, for my latest project, I’m working with simulation predictions to get ocean
                temperature data for the next 10 years, or for every five days, for example. To obtain these temperature
                predictions, we need to set up some parameters, so we have a parameter set and corresponding outputs.
                The goal is to use machine learning to predict these outputs more efficiently. Essentially, machine
                learning helps us generate predictions faster than waiting for the entire simulation results.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="interview-section">
            <p class="timestamp">[00:01:32]</p>
            <p class="speaker">Can Alpay:</p>
            <p class="text">We use machine learning in this area because the ocean data is enormous. We start by
                reducing the resolution of the data to manage its size, then perform predictions using Convolutional
                Neural Networks (CNNs) and Graph Neural Networks. After generating predictions, we incrementally
                increase the resolution back to the original size and assess the quality compared to the actual
                simulation output. This is the basic pipeline of what I’m doing.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="interview-section">
            <p class="timestamp">[00:02:02]</p>
            <p class="speaker">Can Alpay:</p>
            <p class="text">More specifically, I’m also working on time series prediction. For instance, when you run
                simulations, you get data for 10 consecutive years, with outputs for each month. Machine learning models
                typically focus on predicting a single time frame, like June 5 after five years. The downside of this
                approach is that it only provides predictions for one time frame at a time, rather than the entire
                10-year span. To address this, I’m developing machine learning models that can generate recurrent
                predictions, forecasting one period after another using previous data. I then test these predictions for
                accuracy.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="interview-section">
            <p class="timestamp">[00:02:53]</p>
            <p class="speaker">Can Alpay:</p>
            <p class="text">What I’m doing is similar to asset pricing, such as stock or cryptocurrency prediction.
                While the core idea of time series forecasting is similar, the data construction differs. Instead of a
                single data point predicting the next, ocean temperature data involves a more complex and extensive data
                structure.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="interview-section">
            <p class="timestamp">[00:03:38]</p>
            <p class="speaker">Can Alpay:</p>
            <p class="text">At a certain point, what we do is generate the graph. Because the ocean data is enormous and
                consists of unstructured mesh data, we construct a graph to represent that mesh. This graph is still
                quite large, so we aim to simplify it. For example, instead of representing thousands of nodes for
                Antarctica, we might represent it with a single node, assuming that the data doesn’t change
                significantly over a period of four or five years. This simplification reduces the complexity of the
                graph. We first find a way to simplify it and then use the graph structure for predictions over
                different time steps. We try to predict the next graph structure with temperatures. The approach is a
                bit different, but the baseline idea is the same: it's essentially forecasting.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="interview-section">
            <p class="timestamp">[00:04:30]</p>
            <p class="speaker">Farhan Sadeek:</p>
            <p class="text">My next question is: How would you explain machine learning to a five-year-old? What is it
                exactly? Can you repeat the beginning of the question? Yeah, so this is for a science writing interview.
                I understand what machine learning is, but if you were explaining it to a child, how would you describe
                it?</p>
        </div>

        <div class="interview-section">
            <p class="timestamp">[00:05:15]</p>
            <p class="speaker">Can Alpay:</p>
            <p class="text">For a simple explanation, I would say: Imagine you have a lot of pictures, some of cats and
                some of dogs. Machine learning is like teaching a computer to recognize the difference between them. For
                example, when you look at cat pictures versus dog pictures, you notice that cats and dogs have different
                features. Your brain can process this and tell them apart. To teach a computer to do the same, you show
                it many pictures of cats and dogs. The computer learns the features that make a cat different from a
                dog. Then, when you show it a new picture, it can say if it’s a cat or a dog based on what it learned.
                Essentially, machine learning is about teaching a computer to recognize patterns from data so it can
                make predictions or decisions on new, unseen data.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="interview-section">
            <p class="timestamp">[00:07:33]</p>
            <p class="speaker">Can Alpay:</p>
            <p class="text">In machine learning, we don’t explicitly tell the computer what to do. Instead, it learns
                from the data we provide. Yes, exactly. So, regarding healthcare, I know you’ve worked with
                organizations related to healthcare. How can machine learning impact healthcare? For example, it could
                be used in cancer or tumor detection. How can machine learning make a difference in healthcare?</p>
        </div>

        <div class="interview-section">
            <p class="timestamp">[00:08:34]</p>
            <p class="speaker">Can Alpay:</p>
            <p class="text">Building on my previous explanation, pathology detection is quite straightforward. You show
                the computer images of disease and normal tissue, and it learns to identify the differences. For
                instance, it can identify problematic areas in new images based on what it has learned. Beyond pathology
                detection, machine learning can also be used to understand and analyze medical articles. For example, if
                you have a medical text that is difficult to understand, you can use machine learning to explain it more
                clearly.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="interview-section">
            <p class="timestamp">[00:09:19]</p>
            <p class="speaker">Can Alpay:</p>
            <p class="text">To give specific examples: First, you can train a machine learning model with medical images
                and teach it to identify problems, such as diseases or tumors. Second, you can use machine learning like
                a virtual doctor. By inputting symptoms into a system trained with extensive medical knowledge, the
                system can suggest possible diagnoses. One of my friends used ChatGPT for this purpose; by providing
                symptoms and medical records, it could identify potential problems.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="interview-section">
            <p class="timestamp">[00:10:48]</p>
            <p class="speaker">Can Alpay:</p>
            <p class="text">Third, machine learning can enhance the efficiency of medical imaging processes like MRIs.
                Instead of taking 40 minutes for an MRI scan, machine learning can help create high-quality images more
                quickly. It can also reconstruct a 3D structure from multiple 2D images, improving diagnostic accuracy
                and efficiency.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="interview-section">
            <p class="timestamp">[00:13:44]</p>
            <p class="speaker">Can Alpay:</p>
            <p class="text">To clarify the third point: Machine learning can make the MRI process faster by focusing on
                specific parts of the image that may indicate issues. Instead of constructing an entire 3D image from
                scratch, AI can reconstruct 3D structures from various 2D perspectives, presenting a more comprehensive
                view to doctors.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="interview-section">
            <p class="timestamp">[00:14:27]</p>
            <p class="speaker">Can Alpay:</p>
            <p class="text">The general idea is to use AI to enhance the speed and accuracy of medical imaging, making
                it easier for doctors to diagnose and treat patients.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="interview-section">
            <p class="timestamp">[00:14:34]</p>
            <p class="speaker">Farhan Sadeek:</p>
            <p class="text">Now, let's discuss the limitations and ethical concerns associated with these technologies.
                For example, one issue is data privacy, as medical data needs to be stored and managed securely. Are
                there other potential issues or ethical concerns?</p>
        </div>

        <div class="interview-section">
            <p class="timestamp">[00:15:10]</p>
            <p class="speaker">Can Alpay:</p>
            <p class="text">If you could just give us a little bit of an overview on how each of these could pose some
                issues or implications. Yeah. So the easiest way. Yeah. Yeah. So the biggest challenge is that you
                cannot trust AI all the time. So let's say you have a model with 95% accuracy. It means that 5% of your
                patients could be wrongly diagnosed or not diagnosed at all. For instance, if you have cancer in your
                stomach, and the AI tells you that you don’t have cancer, you are wrongly diagnosed and therefore not
                treated. When this happens, whose fault is it? This is a significant concern in the healthcare system
                and medicine.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="interview-section">
            <p class="timestamp">[00:15:58]</p>
            <p class="speaker">Can Alpay:</p>
            <p class="text">The biggest challenge is that as long as you don’t have a 100% accurate machine, you cannot
                fully trust it. You have to use some type of doctors or observers at different steps to verify the
                results. But that’s a problem because, as we start using AI, we are likely to treat more patients than
                we usually do. This means we increase the workload for observers as well, which becomes an issue. I
                don’t know how they’re going to solve it, but this is a huge concern. I remember when I was in
                university, I did a project with 95% accuracy, and I was very happy with it.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="interview-section">
            <p class="timestamp">[00:16:42]</p>
            <p class="speaker">Can Alpay:</p>
            <p class="text">But then the professor was very concerned because it meant that 5% of the patients would be
                wrongly treated. Who would want to go to a hospital where there is a 5% chance of getting a wrong
                diagnosis every day? That’s a significant concern about AI. The second concern is that even if AI
                provides the right treatment, the human factor is still very vital in this process, especially in
                medicine.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="interview-section">
            <p class="timestamp">[00:17:26]</p>
            <p class="speaker">Can Alpay:</p>
            <p class="text">For instance, whenever I get the results, I pass them to ChatGPT to see what it says. It
                might say, "You have blah, blah, blah," and then explain it to me. But I still wait for a doctor to
                review it because I don’t fully trust AI at the moment. I want to get some input from a human so that I
                can say, "Okay, this is acceptable."</p>
        </div>

        <div class="interview-section">
            <p class="timestamp">[00:17:58]</p>
            <p class="speaker">Can Alpay:</p>
            <p class="text">This is specific to me, but I believe most people will still feel this way—that they don’t
                trust AI completely. That’s the second part. The third concern involves ethical issues and potential
                problems. One major issue is that AI might start treating different races unfairly. For example, if most
                of the Hispanic people in the dataset have stomach cancer, the AI might wrongly diagnose someone of
                Hispanic descent with stomach cancer based on their race.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="interview-section">
            <p class="timestamp">[00:18:49]</p>
            <p class="speaker">Can Alpay:</p>
            <p class="text">This is a huge concern because if your data lacks variety in terms of race, age, and other
                factors, the AI might give the same diagnosis to every 27-year-old patient or make similar errors. The
                biggest problem with machine learning is that you believe the model has learned the patterns, but 99% of
                the time, you don’t know what patterns the model has learned. It’s like the black box issue in machine
                learning—you don’t know exactly what the model is doing under the hood.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="interview-section">
            <p class="timestamp">[00:19:52]</p>
            <p class="speaker">Can Alpay:</p>
            <p class="text">For example, the AI might consistently give the same result to every Black person who is 27
                years old. As the model becomes more specific, it may focus on particular patterns and provide
                consistent outputs for similar features. This lack of transparency is a major concern because you don’t
                know what the model has learned. When you see a doctor, they don’t consider your race, but you don’t
                know whether your AI model does.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="interview-section">
            <p class="timestamp">[00:21:16]</p>
            <p class="speaker">Can Alpay:</p>
            <p class="text">You may try to exclude race from the model, but that can introduce other problems. Machine
                learning cannot be told to learn specific features directly; you have to provide a large amount of data
                and let the model learn from it. That’s a huge problem. This black box issue isn’t confined to the
                healthcare system; it’s an issue everywhere.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="interview-section">
            <p class="timestamp">[00:22:03]</p>
            <p class="speaker">Can Alpay:</p>
            <p class="text">For example, I read in an article from a class on ethics that AI was used to identify
                potential terrorists in airports. The model was set up, but after a day or two, it was canceled because
                it only targeted people from the Middle East. This was a problem because the data used for training the
                model was skewed.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="interview-section">
            <p class="timestamp">[00:22:53]</p>
            <p class="speaker">Can Alpay:</p>
            <p class="text">If you use historical prison data for predicting future crimes, for instance, data from
                before 1995 might be skewed, with 80% of the data consisting of Black people. The AI might then
                disproportionately target Black individuals. This is a huge problem.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="interview-section">
            <p class="timestamp">[00:24:30]</p>
            <p class="speaker">Can Alpay:</p>
            <p class="text">To address these issues, data should be recent and up-to-date. Treatments change over time,
                so using outdated data can lead to incorrect predictions. You need to ensure that data is accurate and
                comprehensive. To enrich the data, you can gather information from various sources, such as different
                hospitals, and use it to build a more robust dataset.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="interview-section">
            <p class="timestamp">[00:25:16]</p>
            <p class="speaker">Can Alpay:</p>
            <p class="text">There are techniques to enrich data, but the simplest approach is to collect data from
                diverse sources to cover different scenarios. Even if you don’t have enough data or notice specific
                patterns in outputs, you can adjust the model by adding more varied examples or penalizing certain
                learning patterns.</p>

            <p class="speaker">Can Alpay:</p>
            <p class="text">For example, if you provide images of people standing and sitting, and the model only sees
                one person standing and another sitting, it might misidentify features. By providing balanced data—both
                people standing and sitting—you can improve the model’s accuracy.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="interview-section">

            <p class="speaker">Can Alpay:</p>
            <p class="text">In summary, to improve healthcare or machine learning predictions and models, ensure the
                data is rich and unbiased. Provide a diverse set of examples to help the model learn accurately and
                avoid introducing biases.</p>

            <p class="speaker">Farhan Sadeek:</p>
            <p class="text">What are some other things we should consider? One thing I’m thinking about is whether there
                is a way to understand how the AI is learning. That might be something to consider.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="interview-section">
            <p class="timestamp">[00:29:58]</p>
            <p class="speaker">Can Alpay:</p>
            <p class="text">Yes, the goal is to understand how the machine learning model is working. However, both
                sides are tricky. I’m thinking of an analogy, but it’s a bit complex. The problem is, when you identify
                how your machine learning model works—i.e., what patterns it has learned—you might inadvertently weaken
                the model. Why? Because if I know how the model treats patients, I can exploit that knowledge to get a
                specific diagnosis or result.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="interview-section">
            <p class="timestamp">[00:30:42]</p>
            <p class="speaker">Can Alpay:</p>
            <p class="text">For instance, if I know how your machine learning model works, and I need to take time off
                work, I could potentially use that information to fake a specific condition and receive the diagnosis I
                want. This is a significant problem. The main reason for the black box nature of machine learning is to
                prevent these types of issues.</p>

            <p class="text">If you know the specifics of how the black box operates, you could manipulate inputs to get
                desired outputs, which is not ideal. Therefore, we need some understanding of how the model learns, even
                if we don’t know the exact patterns it uses. This is why, when you read machine learning articles, they
                explain loss functions, how they derive these functions, and how they use them. By explaining the
                specific parts of these loss functions, you are clarifying how the model learns without explicitly
                revealing the patterns.</p>

            <p class="text">This way, you preserve the black box nature while providing some insight into the learning
                process. This approach helps in making the model more trustworthy while maintaining its protective
                complexity. To enhance the accuracy and reliability of machine learning models, you need to enrich your
                data and provide at least a brief description of what happens inside the black box. This makes the
                system more transparent and trustworthy.</p>

            <p class="text">Another aspect to consider is that you need to continually refine and improve the accuracy
                of the model. Ensuring that the model is as accurate and reliable as possible is crucial. These are some
                of the key considerations that come to mind.</p>

            <p class="text">I think that covers everything. You’ve answered all my questions. Let me quickly share the
                article with you for a better understanding of whether I wrote things correctly. Here’s the link to the
                article I wrote. I’ll add a bit more once I have the transcripts and include some of the points we
                discussed. One last thing: this is just a bit of practice, like conducting an interview, which is a
                professional aspect of the process.</p>
